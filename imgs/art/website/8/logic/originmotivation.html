<h3>Quantum logic: Origin and Motivation</h3>

<p>Von Neumann was the first to realise that the advance in quantum theory must be accompanied by the development of a new kind of logic, powerful enough to describe 
mathematically the nature of quantum mechanics. Thus, in 1932 he began working on a new algebraic structure based on orthomodular lattices. After four years, he was 
in position to prove his findings in a joint paper with Garret Birkhoff.</p>

<p>In 1936 John von Neumann and Garret Birkhoff published a paper entitled &#34;The logic of quantum mechanics&#34;. This marked the birth of quantum logic. The paper consists 
of three parts: physical background, algebraic analysis and conclusions. The introduction highlights the fact that the principles of uncertainty and duality of 
matter make it difficult to predict with certainty the result of an experiment. The paper&#39;s aim is then explained to the reader: &#34;the object of the present paper is 
to discover what logical structure one may hope to find in physical theories which, like quantum mechanics, do not conform to classical logic.&#34;</p> 

<p>Birkhoff and von Neumann explained their motivation in writing the paper: they wanted to construct a logical &#39;calculus&#39; in which, unlike classical logic, the 
uncertainty relations in nature were actually represented. These &#39;uncertainty relations&#39; are based on Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle which states that the more 
we know about one property of a particle (e.g. position), the less we know about its other properties (e.g. momentum).</p>

<p>The paper also demonstrates that the classical distributive law is invalid in the quantum world. In fact, this statement is extremely important as it causes all 
other laws derived from distributivity to fail. The need for a new, more valid logic was needed. Birkhoff and von Neumann implied this idea when they wrote that 
&#34;...whereas logicians have usually assumed that properties of negation were the ones least able to withstand a critical analysis, the study of mechanics points to 
the <b>distributive identities as the weakest link in the algebra of logic.</b>&#34; They moved on to define the modular law, a weakened form of the distributive one. In 1937 
Kodi Husimi discovered that quantum logic should actually involve an even weaker law, called the orthomodular identity.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that quantum logic was born more than 70 years ago, little has ever changed in its principle and structure. Papers about quantum logic have been 
published sporadically expressing new ideas (for example the 1963 paper by George Mackey entitled &#34;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&#34;) but they are 
still based on Birkhoff&#39;s and von Neumann&#39;s original writings.</p>

<p>In 1968 Hilary Putnam published a paper entitled &#34;Is logic empirical?&#34;. In that paper, Putnam argued that our interpretation of logic could change in light of 
recent data. He said that as the theory of relativity caused Euclidean geometry to be revised to a great extent, quantum mechanics should cause classical logic to 
be thoroughly revised as well.</p>
