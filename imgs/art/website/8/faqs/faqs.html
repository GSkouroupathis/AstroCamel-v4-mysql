<h4><a name="a">Which are the key features of quantum theory?</a></h4>
<p>
The key features of quantum theory are:
<ul>
<li>Uncertainty: Werner Heisenberg proposed that there is always some uncertainty about a particle’s physical properties at any time. For example, the more we know about a particle’s position, the less we know about its momentum (formula: ΔxΔp >= h/2   where x = position, p = momentum, h = Planck’s constant). The notion that there is a trade of uncertainties among position, momentum, energy and other properties of particles became known as Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. </li>
<li>Superposition: the idea that a quantum system exists in all its basis states at the same time. </li>
<li>Measurement: the process of determining whether a quantum system satisfies some property (eg. regarding its position). When someone observes a quantum system, the uncertain superposition state of the system is replaced by a definite one (one of its basis states). The other states present in the initial state of superposition are all gone; we cannot use them to make a different measurement.</li>
<li>Entanglement: A pair of quantum particles collectively forms a simple state, where each particle has also a state of its own, or an entangled state, where neither particle has a state of its own. The theory of entanglement tells us that the particles in any entangled state can instantaneously affect each other, even if the distances between them are very big.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="b">What is a quantum computer?</a></h4>
<p>A quantum computer is a machine that uses the laws of quantum mechanics to perform calculations, ideally in a more efficient way than a classical computer.</p>

<h4><a name="c">What is the basic unit of quantum information?</a></h4>
<p>The basic unit of quantum information is the qubit. This can have the states |0> , |1>  or any superposition of these two.</p>

<h4><a name="d">What is logic?</a></h4>
<p>The word “logic” comes from the Greek word “logos”, which means reason.
Logic is considered a part of philosophy. It is represented by symbols and mathematical methods, and it is a tool for proving the validity of arguments. It’s the calculus of computing, a mathematical foundation for handling information and reasoning about programs.</p>

<h4><a name="e">What do we mean by classical logic?</a></h4>
<p>Classical logic is the most fundamental form of logic. It mainly consists of propositional and predicate logics.</p>

<h4><a name="f">What is quantum logic?</a></h4>
<p>Quantum logic is a set of rules that allows us to reason about propositions in a quantum context. These rules, unlike the rules of classical logic, take the principles of quantum theory (such as uncertainty, measurement, superposition, entanglement) into consideration.</p>


<h4><a name="g">What is the origin of quantum logic?</a></h4>
<p>Quantum logic was introduced in the paper entitled “The logic of quantum mechanics” which was published by Garret Birkhoff and John von Neumann in 1936.</p>

<h4><a name="h">What is the connection between quantum physics and quantum logic?</a></h4>
<p>A physical measurement about a quantity A which results in the value μ asserts that the proposition A = μ is true.</p>

<h4><a name="i">What are the main differences between classical and quantum logic?</a></h4>
The main differences are:

<table border="1">

<h4><a name="j">What does quantum logic teach us?</a></h4>
<p>What quantum logic has accomplished is to challenge at a fundamental level our understanding of the world. No matter how many axioms we prove in classical logic, how much we want distributivity to hold or how much we would like to prove the truthfulness of a proposition just by showing that its negation does not hold, we cannot say that these rules stand in the world. Our world is not classical.</p>
