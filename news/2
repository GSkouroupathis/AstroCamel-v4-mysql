GitHub's new ‘Gists’ provide quick and easy code sharing, allowing
the user to do this with much less trouble than creating a repository is. 

The user can now create new files through the company's web interface,
including snippets of code which are too short to bother creating a
brand new Git repository for, but still want to save and share them.

This makes Gists use similar to what Pastebin has been doing all these
years. Yet Gists are said to be way more powerful, since from the moment
of their creation they are considered to be fully worrking Git
repositories which are automatically versioned and forkable by users.

Github's Gists are truly revolutionary, but can they fully replace
Pastebin's simple use? It sure is much quicker to share snippets through
Pastebin, but in the case where you want to save your code and reuse it,
Gists are the way to do it.
