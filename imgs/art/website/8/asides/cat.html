<h3>Schrodinger’s cat</h3>

<p>Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment formed by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1935. In this experiment a cat is thought to be in a closed box along 
with a flask containing poison. The poison will be released according to some random event. In this case, the poison will be released and kill the cat when 
radioactivity is recorded to be present in the box (given out by the radioactive source that is also placed in the box). According to the Copenhagen interpretation 
of quantum mechanics, one cannot know if the cat is alive or dead with certainty; the cat is said to be <b>simultaneously</b> alive and dead. Such state has never been 
observed!</p>

<p>Schrodinger’s thought experiment raises the question of when does a quantum system changes its state from superposition to a single classical one. If we accept 
the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics then we can say that the cat stops being in both Alive and Dead states when an observation / measurement takes 
place, i.e. when someone opens the box and observes the cat. But what is no one opens the box or performs any other similar observation anytime soon? Will the cat 
still be in a mixture of states? Can we ever describe with certainty the health of the cat?</p>

<p>The above argument causes justified questions about the ‘logic’ of quantum mechanics in terms of common sense. Some may say that the quantum theory is false, buggy 
or just crazy. However, one must consider quantum decoherence. This theory says that the wave function (i.e. the overall state) of a macroscopic system may be 
influenced by the environment in such a way that causes it to collapse, thus becoming a single classical state. Therefore, in the case of the cat, the interaction 
of the external environment with the cat to adopt a single state only, Alive or Dead, without involving any measurements. So, on this view, superpositions exist 
even in the macroscopic world but, due to decoherence, they cannot be observed.</p> 

<p>The Schrodinger’s cat paradox leads to a very important conclusion regarding quantum logic: <b>OUR EVERYDAY (MACROSCOPIC) WORLD IS CLASSICAL. </b>Quantum logic did not 
replace the logic that was established centuries ago, but rather it enforced some constraints on it regarding the microscopic world.</p>
