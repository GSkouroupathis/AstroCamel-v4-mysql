<h3>Birkhoff and von Neumann</h3>

<b>The fathers of quantum logic

<br />
<br />
Garrett Birkhoff, 1911-1996</b>

<p>Garrett Birkhoff, son of the great mathematician George David Birkhoff, was born on January 19, 1911 in New Jersey and was an American mathematician, known for his 
work in lattice theory. He studied abstract algebra in Cambridge University, in which he made innovations later on in his career. He also wrote many textbooks and 
papers on abstract algebra and lattice theory. He spent most of his career teaching in Harvard, and he also worked on the development of weaponry in the World War II. 
He did research on fluid dynamics. Birkhoff was interested in the electronic computer, and he worked together with John Von Neumann, with whom he was friends, in 
writing the paper on quantum logic in 1936. He died on November 22, 1996.</p>

<b>John von Neumann, 1903-1957</b>

<p>John von Neumann was born on December 28, 1903. He was a Hungarian-American mathematician who made major contributions to a vast range of fields, like geometry, 
cellular automata, game theory, quantum mechanics and more. From a very young age he had amazing skills in language, memorization and mathematics. He published 
his first major mathematical papers when he was only 19, and was a key figure in computer science. He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum 
mechanics, and in the development of functional analysis. He worked on the ergodic theorem and also the lattice theory. The concept of creating a propositional 
calculus for quantum logic was outlined in John Von Neumann's work in 1932. He also had a contribution to nuclear weapons and the atomic bomb. He acquired many 
honors and published many major papers. He died of cancer on February 8, 1957.</p>
