<h3>Quantum logic: Definition</h3>

<b>What is quantum logic?</b>

<p>Quantum logic is a set of rules that allows us to reason about propositions in a quantum context. These rules, unlike the rules of classical logic, take the 
principles of quantum theory into consideration.</p>

<p>But first of all, what do propositions have to do with the rules of quantum mechanics? What do we mean by the phrase &#34;a formula A holds?&#34; The answer is: <b>a physical 
measurement about a quantity A which results in the value &mu; asserts that the proposition A = &mu; is true.</b> This is an important connection between physics and logic; 
making a measurement is analogous to asserting a corresponding proposition.</p>  

<p>In quantum mechanics the state of a system is determined by its wave function. According to Birkhoff and von Neumann the state should thus be represented by a 
function / phase space, namely the Hilbert space (an infinite-dimensional vector space with an inner product). Every proposition in logic is then associated with 
a closed subspace of the Hilbert space; we say that the proposition is projected onto this space. The truth value of the proposition is determined by the eigenvalues 
of its projector on that space.</p>

<p>The collection of all projectors on the Hilbert space forms a specific lattice on which the operators join (U), meet (&cap;) and complement (&perp;) correspond to the 
logical connectives disjunction (V), conjunction (&and;) and negation (~) respectively.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of quantum logic is the failure of the classical distributive law. Because of this, a weaker version of the distributive 
law (called the modular law) was developed to take the place of its classical predecessor.</p>

<p>When using quantum logic to make inferences, one must be extremely careful on how he uses the specified propositions. Consider this simple example in natural 
deduction:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           given
	<li>B          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    given
	<li>C            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  given
	<li>A &and; B        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &and;I (1,2)
</ul>

<p>In classical logic the above example would be perfectly OK: in any system where the propositions A, B and C hold we can deduce that A &and; B holds. In quantum logic 
however, if we want to deduce the same conclusion then we must consider the extra assumption that there exist no uncertainty relations between A, B and C 
(i.e. knowing B for example does not invalidate what we previously knew about A). Such differences with classical logic are explained in the next page.</p>
