<h3>Quantum Theory</h3>

<p>Quantum theory emerged from the need to find a more comprehensive theory of how our world behaves.
 Despite the fact that Newtonian mechanics are accurate enough to explain how nature behaves in our 
 &quot;everyday&quot; macroscopic world, they fail to account for the behaviour of microscopic particles. Puzzles
 that could not be explained sufficiently with classical physics include the photoelectric effect, light
 emission from a bulb and black body radiation (electromagnetic waves emitted by black bodies in exactly the same way).
 Following the discovery of such unsolved puzzles, physicists began in the late 19th century to search for
 a more comprehensive theory of nature to deal with the weaknesses of classical physics.</p>

<p>In 1900 the German physicist Max Planck stated that he made a discovery as important as Newtonian physics. 
What Planck proposed was that light (and energy in general) comes in discrete amounts which he called quanta.
 He then introduced the formula E = hf (E = energy, h = Planck&#39;s constant = 6.626 x 10<sup>-34</sup> Js, f = frequency of the wave).
 This observation marked the birth of Quantum mechanics which, unlike Newtonian mechanics, applies to everything.</p>

<p>Following the path showed by Max Planck, a number of great physicists of the 20th century proposed some significant 
theories in the field of quantum mechanics:</p>

<p><i>Albert Einstein, 1905</i>: Einstein managed to explain the photoelectric effect by stating that light causes 
surfaces to emit electrons and that the energy of these emitted electrons depends only on the frequency of light.</p>

<p><i>Niels Bohr, 1922</i>: Bohr used Planck&#39;s theory of quanta to show that the electrons behave in a wave-like manner in the structure of the atom.</p>

<p><i>Louis de Broglie, 1924</i>: de Broglie stated the wave-particle duality theory. This says that everything has both particle properties like mass and momentum, 
as well as wave properties like diffraction and interference.</p>

<p><i>Erwin Schrodinger, 1926</i>: The Austrian physicist Schrodinger published his work on wave mechanics. 
This included the so called Schrodinger&#39;s equation that describes how the state of a quantum system changes with respect to time.</p>

<p><i>Max Born, 1926</i>: Born&#39;s theory says that the amplitudes of the waves in matter represent probabilities associated with different events happening. 
In fact, the intensity of a wave (= the absolute square of the amplitude) at any point tells us the probability of finding the particle at that point. 
This implies also that constructive interference raises the probability of a particle to be at the expected location. 
Born&#39;s work shows that quantum mechanics gives us only probabilities (quantum theory is probabilistic).</p>

<p><i>Werner Heisenberg, 1927</i>: Heisenberg proposed that there is always some uncertainty about a particle&#39;s physical properties at any time. 
For example, the more we know about a particle&#39;s position, the less we know about its momentum 
(formula: &Delta;x&Delta;p >= h/2   where x = position, p = momentum, h = Planck&#39;s constant). The notion that there is a trade of uncertainties among position, 
momentum, energy and other properties of particles became known as Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle.</p>

<p><i>Niels Bohr, 1927</i>: Bohr introduced the principle of complementarity. This states that an experiment can demonstrate the 
wave-like properties of matter (eg interference, diffraction), or its particle-like properties (eg mass, momentum); but not both at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936</i>: Birkhoff and von Neumann created the &#34;quantum logic&#34; to provide a formal &#39;calculus&#39; for quantum mechanics.</p>

<p><i>Richard Feynman, 1948</i>: Feynman proposed the sum over histories quantum approach. This says that the total probability of a particle going 
from point A to B is the sum of the squares of all the amplitudes of all the different ways to go.</p>

<p><i>John Bell, 1964</i>: Bell argued against the EPR (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen) argument which stated that particles are influenced only by local hidden variables. 
In his opinion, the particles are instantaneously influenced by the other distant particles (quantum entanglement).</p>

<p><i>Richard Feynman, 1982</i>: Feynman introduced the idea of a quantum computer, a machine that would be capable of utilising certain quantum aspects in its advantage.</p>

<p>During the 20th century there were great debates among physicists about certain aspects or &#39;drawbacks&#39; of the quantum theory. 
Various interpretations of quantum mechanics have been developed as a consequence. The three main ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copenhagen interpretation: the most popular interpretation. It was developed mainly by Bohr and Heisenberg and includes the principles of uncertainty and complementarity. 
It also highlights the wave-particle duality of matter and the view that nature is probabilistic.</li>
<li>Hidden variables: this interpretation claims that the results of measurements are predetermined by &#39;hidden variables&#39; that exist in nature.</li>
<li>Many worlds: this interpretation suggests that one can see only one &#39;world&#39; in which something took one possible action. 
However there exist other worlds in which it chose to do something else.</li>
</ul>
