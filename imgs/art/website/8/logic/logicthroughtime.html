<h3>Logic Through Time</h3>

<p>Logic exists for almost 2400 years in this illogical world, and it has been one of the reasons why humans lasted for so long.</p> 

<p>The word &#34;logic&#34; come from the Greek word &#34;logos&#34; , which means reason.
<br />
Logic is considered a part of philosophy, that with the use of symbols and mathematical methods, is a tool for proving the validity of arguments.
<br />
It&#39;s the calculus of computing, a mathematical foundation for handling information and reasoning about programs.</p>

<p>A logical system consists of Syntax (a formal language to express concepts), Semantics (meaning for Syntax), and Proof Theory 
(a way of arguing about valid statements).</p>

<p>The most essential concept in logic is that of <i>logical consequence</i>. Logical consequence is a relation between two statements that is of the 
form &#34;A follows from B&#34; or &#34;A can be deduced from B&#34; (if-statements). Logical deduction is vital to our everyday behavior, and thus it is of great 
significance that modern science has provided us with the tools to study and analyze the concept of logical consequence.
<br />
<br />
As an example, consider Aristotle&#39;s most famous syllogism:
<br />
<br />
<b>Premises:</b>
<br />
(1)	All men are mortal
<br />
(2)	Socrates is a man
<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<br />
(3)	Socrates is mortal.</p>
<p> The various kinds of logic are listed in the the timeline below:

<b><u>Foundations of Logic</u></b>

<p>Two of the most basic forms of logic are Propositional and Predicate Logic. These two make up the so-called classical logic.</p>

<b>Propositional Logic:</b>

<p>As shown in the timeline, propositional logic was first developed by Chrysippus and the Stoics in ancient Greece. The initial system of this logic was ambiguous 
to people in later years, so it was redeveloped by Peter Abelard.
Propositional logic handles if-tests and statements with the use of boolean operators, and by using a set of symbols, rules and axioms, formulas can be derived, 
and also equivalences between binary relations can be proved. The truth values that propositions can take are two, True and False.</p>

<b>Predicate (First-Order) Logic: </b>

<p>The difference of predicate logic from propositional logic, is that it makes use of quantifiers and predicates. It allows reasoning about properties that are 
shared by many objects, by using variables.</p>

<b>Boolean Algebra:</b>

<p>Boolean Algebra (logic) is like algebra with numbers, but the numerical operations are replaced by logical operations, in order to calculate truth values. 
It&#39;s two- valued (true and false) and its rules can be defined axiomatically (axioms with their logical consequences &#45; theorems) , or semantically 
(equations that are true at every situation).</p>

<b>Many-valued Logic:</b>

<p>In many-valued logic, there are more than two truth values.
There&#39;s three-valued logic that takes the values truth, false and unknown, the finite-valued with more than three values, and the infinite-valued , such as fuzzy 
logic (that takes values between 0 and 1) and probability logic, where truth values of sentences are probabilities.</p>

<br />
<b><u>Use of logic in computing</u></b>

<p>Logic is used in many ways in computing. Programmers are responsible for the correctness of their programs, so they use logic to reason about them, in order to 
avoid errors that could have bad consequences.
Logic is also used in natural deduction, a proof system used to show that formulas are valid by using inference rules. It was invented by F. B. Fitch. A proof can 
be reached by reasoning on some given facts/formulas using the system's rules. Each step of the proof is a valid argument and can be used later on.
Furthermore, there are logic programming languages, the most popular being Prolog, which was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel. It&#39;s a 
declarative language, containing rules, facts and relations which are used in a query to implement a computation. It's used in theorem proving, expert systems, 
games, automated answering systems and more. Logic programming is generally used to control the behaviour of a program to see if it's working as it should.
Finally, the hardware &#39;gates&#39; are created based on logical connectives like conjunction and disjunction. Logic gates are ways of manipulating bits: given a set of 
binary digits they perform on them a logical operation (AND, OR, NOT, etc) to output a resultant bit. At hardware level, this is modeled by the electric current 
flowing through the computer circuit: when the current flows through a gate, its resultant bit is 1, when it does not, the resultant bit is 0. These two values 
correspond to the truth values of Truth and Falsity in classical logic. The behavior of classical logic gates can be completely described in terms of Boolean algebra.
Some common logic gates include NOT, OR, AND, NOR, NAND, XOR and XNOR.</p>

As an example, consider the AND gate:
