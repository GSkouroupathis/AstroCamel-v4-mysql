<h3>Quantum States</h3>


<p>Quantum mechanics declare that particles can be in different &#39;states&#39;. But what do we mean by 
quantum states and how do we use them to explain the results from the experiments? What follows is a set 
of definitions and mathematical representations related to quantum mechanics.</p>

<p><b>State:</b> a physical situation of a particle or any other quantum piece of the world (system). It is represented by the Ket notation:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;				| STATE_LABEL &#62;<br />
Some properties like the inner product of two states are represented by the Bra-Ket notation. Eg:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		&#60; A | B &#62;     is the inner product or state | A &#62;   with   state | B &#62;</p>

<p><b>Basis state:</b> a definite state which describes one possible result of some measurement.</p>

<p><b>Superposition:</b> the idea that a quantum system exists in all its basis states at the same time.
 When a measurement occurs it adopts the state of just one of its basis states. E.g.: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			| SUPERPOSITION &#62;   = a | 0 &#62;   +   b | 1 &#62;<br />
  where a and b are complex numbers representing the amplitudes of the waves of each state. 
  Each basis state has an associated probability of becoming the definite state of the system, equal to |amplitude|2.</p>

<p><b>Rule of superposition:</b> the superposition of some quantum states is also a quantum state.</p>

<p><b>Observables:</b> variables that a particle has like position, momentum and energy. When measured 
these variables portray the quantum state of the particle. Observables are represented mathematically
 by operators which act on the Hilbert space.</p>

<p><b>Observation space:</b> the set of all possible values an observable can take as a result of an experiment.</p>

<p><b>Measurement:</b> the process of determining whether a quantum system satisfies some property
 (eg. regarding its position). There are two rules associated with measurement:
<ul>
<li>If no measurement occurs on a quantum system then the state of the system changes 
non-probabilistically (i.e. in a definite way). The new state preserves any superposition.</li>         
<li>In case of a measurement involved, the state is updated randomly according to the
 probabilities of each basis state. The new state is what we see as the result of the measurement.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Wave function, &#968;:</b> a mathematical function which describes the state of a quantum system.
 When someone observes a quantum system (i.e. when someone makes a measurement) the wave function 
 &#39;collapses&#39; and the uncertain state of the system is replaced by a definite one
 (one of its basis states). The other states present in the initial state of superposition are
 all gone; we cannot use them to make a different measurement.</p>

<p>We will an example to illustrate this important side effect of measurement. 
Suppose we have a light source, two beam splitters, two full mirrors and two 
photon detectors in the configuration shown below. When a photon meets a beam 
splitter it has a 50% chance to get reflected and 50% to pass through, whereas 
when it meets a full mirror it is definitely reflected.</p>

<p>The state of a photon emitted by the light source is:<br />
|photon &#62; =       1/&radic;2 | upper &#62;   +   1/&radic;2 | lower &#62;<br />
    where upper (1) and lower (0) represent the two different paths that the photon can take, each with probability equal to half.</p>

<p>Suppose now that we make a measurement to find out the actual path that the photon takes. 
We place the measuring device in the upper path. If we find the photon there, the state of 
the photon reduces from the initial state of superposition to the definite basis state | upper&#62;,
 since we are 100% sure that the upper path was chosen. If we don&#39;t find the photon there, then 
 it must have travelled in the lower path in which case its state now is |lower&#62;. In either case,
 the measurement we made on the system destroyed the state the photon had in the beginning.</p>

<b>Entanglement:</b>
<br />
<p>A pair of quantum particles collectively forms a simple state, where each 
particle has also a state of its own, or an entangled state, where neither 
particle has a state of its own. The theory of entanglement tells us that the
 particles in any entangled state can instantaneously affect each other, even 
 if the distances between them are very big. In particular, when a measurement 
 is made to one of these particles causing it to take a definite state, the other
 particle will take a correlated definite state as well.</p>
